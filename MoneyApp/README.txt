This simple yet effective application was created for the training of my children pertaining to financial responsibility.  

Simply put, the application takes a serial number (generated from either a cryptographic function in the file generator2.html,
Or you can use the built in functions that I have created to generate a string length with random numbers/letters/chars of your choice.

This program uses the codes generated to assign to fake money, with an imprinted serial number (the actual code that has been generated)
and a face of your choice to dispaly on the money.  You can generate/create face/print all from the generator2.html file.  I did not create
this file, but only the money_manager and script.js.  I received the generator file from a professor at MetroState St.Paul with his permission.

Next, the array can be hard coded (if generated by the generator2.html into the script.js program, or you can generate an array in the script.js.

After you have the array, you need to obviously make sure you're using the same array of codes in your program as you are on your money.

NOTE: This program is not intended to be secure as it runs in LOCAL STORAGE on the browser.  That means it retains all codes, variables, etc.
in local storage.  Anyone with some basic computer knowledge and interest would be able to find the codes in their own browser, but this application
was built for training children, so it was not of concern.  

Be advised, that the login pages do work and were for the purpose of training the children on logins and strong/weak password cases.  You can use 
these if you want, or just go straight to money_manager.  There are some simple password functions that do work with the login pages.

Here are the steps you need to take to ensure your page operates smoothly:

1. Include the related styles sheet(styles.css) the script (scripts.js) and the money_manager (money_manager.html) in the same directory.

2.  After you have the files in the same directory, go ahead and open money_manager.html.  Once money manager is open, 
press CTRL+SHIFT+I to open up developer tools in Chrome or Firefox.  Brows to local storage (under settings gear icon on right for firefox, if it's
not already visible) or under Application on Chrome) and bring up Local Storage.  

3. With the developer tools open and the web page still visible, click LOAD link on the upper menu. 

4. You will be prompted for a password.  After you enter the correct password (complicatedpassword) a function will 
automatically be called to load in a hard coded array(list of codes) for you.  The codes of this array can be used initially in the generator2.html to generate
the money.  

5.  After you have loaded, verify that the array and variables are loaded in local storage (the items should populate).  
Next, please REFRESH your browser for the changes to take effect.  

6.  After you have refreshed your browser, try a test code from the array that has printed out in the CONSOLE.  You will need to open the 
console section under developer tools.  Copy and Paste a value into the ADD MONEY box with the $$$$$ signs.  

7.  Click the button, and you should get an alert that the code is VALID.  You will notice that a table on the bottom of the page 
automatically AUTO POPULATES with the date/time, the code, and the current balance.

8.  If the table does not auto populate, refresh the browser, try the code again.  Sometimes things can get hung up here, but once it gets going
it's just fine.  

9. The program allows for ADD money of $1 increments, which I found very useful for children.  The Generator2 file has only $10 bill, but it's easy to 
explain to the kids that the bill is really only worth $1 in your household.  

10.  No code can be redeemed twice.  The code that has been entered will AUTOMATICALLY be removed from the array for no future use.
Be advised that a child MAY take money from a sibling and enter it into THEIR program on THEIR computer, unless you have two seperate arrays.  
The way to get around this is just to be up front about it and tell them the rules.  If not, just create yourself a separate array for the other
child on their own computer.  Each 

11.  Each computer this program runs on will store its own data on the hard drive for that computer.  If the computer crashes you lose the data. Have
the kids hold onto their money in case you need to re-start things and re-populate their bank.

12. The functionality of this is limitless and you can take it even further than I have.  In fact, I have some plans for the future.

13. To RECYCLE the program, delete local storage from the browser and start from step 1.
